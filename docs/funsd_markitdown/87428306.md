COMPOUND PHYSICAL PARAMETERS
ome T
crystalline solid at room temperature which melts at >56*C.
‘The pi of a 50% concentration of A221 in water was theoretically
calculated to be 7.26 at 22°C from a 0.5% solution in 79.5% aqueous
dioxane according to the extrapolation procedures of Dr. B.D.
Schickedantz, Lozillard Accession Number 1662. ReferencetfiS~i0-1.
Not Determined.
